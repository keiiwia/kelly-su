                    <p class="description">"Word salad" refers to a string of words or phrases that are confused, nonsensical, and/or difficult to understand. Medically, it's a symptom of a thought/personality disorder where words are jumbled into a meaningless collection. Generally, it describes any communication that lacks any sense of substance.</p>
                    <p class="description">The "word salad" aspect comes into play when the user chooses words, sometimes nonsensically—perhaps trying to string together bits of poetry or meaning, similar to how people who struggle with dysgraphia and schizophrenia have intent to speak, but their words don't come out right.</p>

                    <p class="description">Living in NYC and along the Hudson River, I see a lot of cargo ships coming in and out of the ports. The main questions at play when observing said ships are:</p>
                    <ul class="description">
                        <li>How does the Hudson River act in this way, in our modern era of automobile vehicular transportation, airplane/aero vehicular transport, and train railways?</li>
                        <li>When we see the cargo boats going through the Hudson and docking at the different ports, how much of that cargo belongs to what we've purchased/will purchase on a day-to-day basis?</li>

                        <h3>Research Process</h3>
                        <p class="description">There were 5 main categories I sorted the cargo imported/exported into:</p>
                        <ul class="description">
                            <li>Food & agriculture</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p class="description">The FAF uses 43 categories, and the PANYNJ Yearly Trade Reports do not detail every category/commodity that is listed/tracked by the FAF, but only the top 10 commodities. I had to extrapolate with the data I had gathered from the four main sources listed previously.</p>

                        <p class="description">If the information is displayed via PDF, I inputted the source PDF itself and gave several strict criterion for GPT to look for and gather into a JSON file:</p>
                        <ul class="description">
                            <li>Top 10 Containerized Imports (in TEUs)</li>
                            <li>Top 10 Containerized Exports (in TEUs)</li>

                        <p class="description">Between the years of data collection (2018-2024), the units listed began to shift from TEU's (standardized containerized units) to metric tons. For this, I also required GPT to reconvert metric tons into TEU's for standardization. The general estimate formula for a TEU is: <code>TEUs = (metric tons × 1000) ÷ 24</code></p>

                    <p class="description">I first began thinking about machine learning while working on a project in collaboration with the Human Language and Development Lab at the NSSR. I was researching how computers determine color from pictures humans input, and I was inspired by an article software developer Austin Poor wrote about algorithmically determining color palettes from movie stills. <a href="https://austinpoor.com/blog/algorithmic-color-palettes" target="_blank">https://austinpoor.com/blog/algorithmic-color-palettes</a></p>
                    <p class="description">I, too, wanted to use machine learning to determine color palettes, no matter the scene, however many times, so I coded a ML algorithm program (in Vanilla Javascript) that would go through the HSL/RGB colors for all images inputted, and return color palettes for each image depending on which clustering method was utilized. For this project, I chose two ML algorithms: K-Means clustering and Agglomerative clustering.</p>
