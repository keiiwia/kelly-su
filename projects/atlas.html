                <p>Atlas was designed for the Sanofi–IDEO Device Innovation Challenge 2025. The brief: reimagine the on-body drug delivery system (OBDS) experience. Existing devices like Omnipod, enFuse, and Vertiva solve the clinical problem — but they ignore the human experience. Anxiety. Stigma. Forgetting. Caregiver burden. The device ends its job the moment the dose is administered. The patient's life doesn't.</p>
                <p>Atlas is a modular ecosystem of three connected objects: an OBDS device, a smartwatch, and a home speaker dock. Together they address the full arc of living with a chronic condition — not just the moment of administration.</p>

                <p>The existing OBDS market treats drug delivery as the end goal. Omnipod, enFuse, and Vertiva are clinically effective. But they're designed around the device, not around the person wearing it. We started by asking: what does a day with chronic illness actually feel like?</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The device ends. The condition doesn't.</h2>
                <p>We conducted patient interviews with people managing chronic conditions requiring regular OBDS use. Two quotes shaped the entire project direction.</p>

                <div class="project-quote">
                    <p>"Sometimes it feels like I'm wearing a big sign that says 'I'm medically disabled.'"</p>
                    <cite>— Type 1 Diabetes OBDS user</cite>
                </div>

                <div class="project-quote">
                    <p>"I do tend to forget. I have my reminder on my phone, but if I switch it off I forget later."</p>
                    <cite>— Injector pen user</cite>
                </div>

                <p>These two quotes pointed at two separate failure modes that the market hadn't addressed together: the emotional experience of wearing a medical device in public, and the cognitive failure of passive reminder systems.</p>

                <h3>Four opportunities from research</h3>
                <p><strong>Reduce administration anxiety.</strong> Redesign the moment of administration, not just the mechanism. The ritual matters as much as the result.</p>
                <p><strong>Make forgetting structurally harder.</strong> Passive phone reminders fail. The system needs to integrate with the patient's environment — their home, their wrist, their routine.</p>
                <p><strong>Design for the full ecosystem.</strong> Caregivers, clinicians, and pharma partners are underserved. The device serves the patient; the platform can serve everyone.</p>
                <p><strong>Make the device livable.</strong> Form, color, and materials aren't cosmetic choices for a chronic condition patient — they're functional. A device you're proud to wear gets worn. A device that signals illness gets hidden.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Two pivots that unlocked the final design</h2>
                <p>Our first version explored a detachable touchscreen "core unit" that refunctioned as a smartwatch or small speaker. The idea: one device that does everything. A Tamagotchi-style digital companion for managing treatment.</p>
                <p>It tested badly. Too many moving parts, too much cognitive overhead, overlapping functions that added complexity without adding value. We stripped it back.</p>

                <figure class="project-figure">
                    <img src="../project-imgs/atlas-v1.png" alt="Atlas early concept — combined touchscreen unit">
                    <figcaption>Early concept: one unit trying to do everything. Tested poorly — users found it overwhelming.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Pivot 1: Screen → dedicated smartwatch</h3>
                <p>Instead of the OBDS carrying a screen, we separated the interaction entirely. The smartwatch handles all patient-facing communication: reminders, administration guidance, health tracking, the digital companion. It magnetically docks to the OBDS during treatment, then returns to daily wear. Familiar interaction model, fewer failure points, cleaner form on the body.</p>

                <h3>Pivot 2: Syringe pump → peristaltic pump</h3>
                <p>The syringe pump mechanism required a form factor too large for the rounded, wearable shape we needed. Switching to a peristaltic pump — inspired by IV drip mechanics — reduced the physical footprint significantly while improving delivery consistency. One constraint solved two problems simultaneously.</p>

                <p>Modular needle heads — hypodermic or microneedle depending on treatment. Octopus-inspired suction adhesive that maintains contact through sweat and body oils. Reusable 30mL cartridge. Peristaltic pump for consistent delivery. Soft rounded form available in a full skin tone range plus expressive colors — because a device you're proud to wear gets worn.</p>

                <p>Tracks health metrics continuously. Layered reminder cadence: 24 hours, 1 hour, and 10 minutes before each dose. AI-guided multilingual administration instructions reduce errors at the moment of use. A pixel-art digital companion — subtle, not infantilizing — provides emotional continuity across the treatment day.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Designed for the full care network</h2>
                <p>One of the core failures of existing OBDS products is that they're designed for a single user — the patient — while ignoring everyone else in the care network. Atlas was designed for four stakeholders simultaneously.</p>

                <h3>Emily — the patient</h3>
                <p>Multilingual administration guidance, adaptive reminder cadence, a device that doesn't signal illness to everyone around her. Reduced anxiety at every step of the treatment ritual.</p>

                <h3>Peter — the caregiver</h3>
                <p>Remote monitoring through the app without hovering in person. His father maintains independence; Peter maintains peace of mind.</p>

                <h3>Dr. Lin — the clinician</h3>
                <p>Real-time adherence data. Fewer administration errors. Confidence that the patient is following the treatment protocol between appointments.</p>

                <h3>PharmaCorp — the pharma partner</h3>
                <p>Refillable cartridges reduce packaging waste and enable subscription logistics. Anonymized adherence data provides population-level insight. A branded patient ecosystem creates a direct ongoing relationship with users — not just a one-time prescription.</p>

                <p>The hardest design decision on Atlas wasn't a form factor or a feature — it was learning to cut. Our first version was technically interesting. The final version was actually useful. Stripping complexity while preserving ambition is a skill, and it's one I only developed because the early prototype tested so badly.</p>
                <p>The bigger lesson was about scope. We could have designed a better syringe. Instead we designed a system that serves a patient, their caregiver, their doctor, and their pharma company simultaneously — and makes each of their lives meaningfully easier. That's what "product thinking" actually means when the stakes are healthcare.</p>
